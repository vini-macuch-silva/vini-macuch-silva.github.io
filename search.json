In my PhD, I’m investigating the extent to which pragmatic language processing and production might be construed as a probabilistic and incremental process, i.e., as a form of Bayesian inferencing.\nI’m broadly interested in the interplay between language, cognition, and social interaction. I’m particularly interested in issues related to [spontaneous] language use and language evolution, especially insofar as it pertains to sociopragmatic aspects of human communication such as repair, interactional structure, and intention recognition/ action formation and ascription. I also have an interest in [multi]modality and non-verbal communicative behavior.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\n\n\nI’m a post-doctoral researcher at the Institute of Linguistics of the Goethe University Frankfurt, Germany, where I work as a junior fellow of the DFG-funded Visual Communication (ViCom) Research Priority Programme. Prior to that, I worked as a post-doc with Bodo Winter at the University of Birmingham. I did my PhD at the University of Osnabrück, supervised by Michael Franke and Manfred Krifka.\nMy research deals with various aspects of linguistic meaning and how people use language in different communicative settings (e.g. in face-to-face interaction, on the web, etc.). In particular, I’m interested in how people produce and interpret polysemous and polyfunctional linguistic forms in context. I primarily use quantitative empirical methods, including controlled experimentation as well as statistical and corpus-analytic methods, to investigate questions related to pragmatic inferencing, strategic communication, argumentation and stance-taking, as well as expressive and affective meaning.\nAside from being interested in theoretical issues in linguistics and cognitive science, I’m also interested in issues related to research design and methodology, and I teach basic data analysis and statistical modeling skills. Related to that, I co-organize DiscoMatiX, an independent group of researchers working on Discourse and pragMatics using eXperimental approaches (visit https://discomatix.github.io/ for more information).\n\n\n\n",
