Together with Clare Patterson and Morgan Moyer, I organize DiscoMatiX, a group of researchers working on **Disco**urse and prag**Mati**cs using e**X**perimental approaches. Our group is specifically focused on the interface between theoretical and empirical approaches, and we have been organizing online talks with invited speakers since 2023. Visit our website (https://discomatix.github.io/) to find out more.
